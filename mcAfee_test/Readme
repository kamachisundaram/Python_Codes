OS Stress test using python

Modules used
Pytest;- framework which is used for unittesting and stress testing
OS:- Module which interacts with the OS (cross platform supported)

##I converted the existing cpp classes to python Reason for creating new class- getting lot of error in settingup the cpp environment
#class FileOperation does the operations which are related to the file such as creation,deletion,updating file, getting the size of the file
getting the access level of the file

#we created a 3 testcases 
tc1:test_filecreationDeletion
* create a testfile
* get the size
* Modify a file
* delete a file
No exception should be seen
tc2:test_filesizechange
* create a testfile
* get the size
* Modify a file
* verify the file is updated when the data is added
* delete a file
tc3:VerifyTheModification
*Create a testfile
** Add the content
* Read the file
* Verify the content both should be idle

Extension:
These suite can be extended like
Random file creation
Maximum number of file creation
negative test scenarios as well


#execute the Stress Test
python -m pytest -v .\file_io.py --count 10000 > log.txt

1000 mention the execution count
sample log attached

Note: This is the basic script for the filesystem, with this base code we will be able to design a full stress suite
